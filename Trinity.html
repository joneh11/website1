	<h3>Trinity University</h3>
	<p> <a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a>
	 is located in San Antonio, Texas. The University was founded in 1869, and over the course of 150 years, Trinity has been through three different cities and four different campuses. Today, Trinity is <a href="https://new.trinity.edu/about-trinity/rankings-and-value">ranked</a> by U.S. News and World Report as the best college in the West. Other recognitions include, Number 2 in the nation by Money.com for best colleges for merit aid, and number 17 by The Princeton Review for best science labs. As a liberal arts school, Trinity makes it its mission to strengthen the interdisciplinary education of each student. Students are provided with the best education from all different fields and subjects.

	<p> Some of the features about Trinity that I appreciate the most are their emphasis on community and their classroom size. Because of the strong emphasis on community, students are required to live three years on campus. Although that might sound dreadful at first, living on campus and interacting with other students creates a better environment to both study and explore. In addition, the classroom size at Trinity University helps students have a better interaction with professors. Compared to a classroom of 200 and more students, like other Texas Universities, students are in a smaller environment where they are free to ask questions and have better focus by their professors.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The main reason I chose Trinity University was because they offer me amazing financial aid. As a first generation, pell-grant student, my family did not have the money to afford any four year university. Trinity University offers both merit scholarships and additional scholarships that one can apply for separately. On top of merit scholarships, if a student demonstrates that he need financial support, Trinity University helps that student with an additional grant. With the help of government grants and the additional help Trinity University provided, college has been easier for my parents to afford.

	I am currently undecided between majoring in Neuroscience or Biochemistry & Molecular Biology. I hope to major in one of the two because I love science. Neuroscience sparks my interest because I want to learn more about how our brains and nervous system interact. It mixes biology, psychology, physiology, and other fields of science to uncover and learn more about neurons and neural circuits. Because I want to become a surgical oncologist in the future, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology also sparks my interest.  Biochemistry & Molecular Biology focuses on the chemical study of the inside of cells to understand cellular processes. The great thing about Trinity University is that in whatever direction I end up going, both areas of study are taught by excellent professors that make it their mission to prepare their students to excel in their careers. Although both programs are rigorous, they are meant to better shape their students for the future. For more information, here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
